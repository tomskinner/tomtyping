# tomtyping
A way to make normal typed text and make it horrible to read while stile being able to understand whats being typed
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It does this in a few ways

1. Randomly changes the capitalisations in the words. 
2. Insert additional random spaces between words.
3. Include special characters added into words.
4. take a word and scramble the internals of the word. i.e. super becomes speur

Still ToDo 
Scramble word internals #4
A method to copy scrambled text into a new place or to save as a new document.

Additional ToDos

Deployment on a web platform (likely Heroku)
Allow text documents to be read and messed with.
Allow .docx and other text based documents to be loaded.
